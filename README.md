# Module_10_Challenge - Crypto Investments

This Crypto Investments data clustering notebook demonstrates usage of the StandardScalar, PCA, and KMeans packages within scikit-learn. These tools allow one to reduce the total data in a dataset down to smaller, scaled clusters to create more visibly digestible charts to analyze the original data.
